### ðŸ’»React DOM Router

To create a React login, we need to create a form where users can enter their name, email, etc. Using React components, state, and event handlers, we can get this data sent to the server to verify that the information is valid and allow access. We can also use additional libraries to manage and validate this data. In the end, we can store the user's information so that he doesn't have to log in again.

Let's start a little experiment using forms in React.


#### What was developed:

- Create a new component called "Form" using the "create-react-app" function;
- Responsive css;
- React DOM Router using npm or yarn package manager.
- Import the components: In your JavaScript file, import the React DOM Router components you need, such as <Router>, <Link>, and <Route>.
- Create Routes: Define routes to your application's pages using the <Route> component.
- Add the <Router> component: Add the <Router> component to the root of your application and send its routes as child components.
- Creating links between pages: Use the <Link> component to create links between pages in your application
